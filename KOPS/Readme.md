Make sure to save the master node script as master_install.sh and the worker node script as worker_install.sh. Before running the scripts, make them executable using the command chmod +x master_install.sh worker_install.sh. Then, execute the scripts on the respective nodes to set up the Kubernetes master and worker nodes.

Please note that these scripts focus on installing Kops and its dependencies. After installation, you will need to follow the Kops documentation to create and manage your Kubernetes cluster using Kops.

As always, review the official Kops documentation for any updates or changes specific to your environment and adjust the scripts accordingly.
