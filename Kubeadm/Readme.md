Make sure to save the master node script as master_install.sh and the worker node script as worker_install.sh. Before running the scripts, make them executable using the command chmod +x master_install.sh worker_install.sh. Then, execute the scripts on the respective nodes to set up the Kubernetes master and worker nodes.

These scripts are specific to Red Hat and Amazon Linux servers. They use yum package manager and install the required packages accordingly. Please note that the scripts assume you have already set up the appropriate repository configurations for Red Hat or Amazon Linux servers.

As always, review the official Kubernetes documentation for any updates or changes specific to your environment and adjust the scripts accordingly.
