Before running the scripts, make them executable using the command chmod +x master_install.sh worker_install.sh. Then, execute the scripts on the respective nodes to set up the Kubernetes master and worker nodes.

# Please note that these scripts focus on installing Kubespray and its dependencies. After installation, you will need to follow the Kubespray documentation to configure and deploy your Kubernetes cluster using Kubespray.

 # As always, review the official Kubespray documentation for any updates or changes specific to your environment and adjust the scripts accordingly.
