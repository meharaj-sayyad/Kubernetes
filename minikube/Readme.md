# Implemetn Shell scripts for EC2 User data level

When launching your EC2 instances, you can provide the respective script as the user data. The instance will execute the user data script during startup and install Minikube automatically.

Note that these scripts assume that the instances have appropriate access to the internet to download the necessary packages and dependencies. Additionally, make sure to follow the security best practices and configure the EC2 instances and network settings according to your specific requirements.

Please keep in mind that Minikube is primarily intended for local development and testing purposes. For production environments or running Kubernetes clusters with more significant workloads, consider using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for Amazon Linux or AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) for Red Hat, which provide better scalability, manageability, and reliability.




=================================================================================================================================================================================

#
# Start Minikube:
 
    minikube start

# Verify the Minikube installation and status:

   minikube status
   kubectl cluster-info


# You can now interact with the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands.

Keep in mind that the t2.micro instance has limited resources, and running a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes and services might not perform well on this instance type. Minikube is primarily intended for local development and testing purposes, so it's recommended to use a larger instance type or consider using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS if you require a production-ready Kubernetes environment on AWS.

Additionally, ensure that you have followed the necessary security configurations and best practices when deploying a server on AWS.
